Implementation Steps:
Step 1: Sign Up and Create a GitHub Account
1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new account.
2. Set up your profile, including username, email, and security settings.
Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. After logging in, click on New to create a repository.
2. Name your repository and select its visibility (public or private).
3. Optionally, initialize the repository with a README file.
Step 3: Clone the Repository Locally
Use Git to clone the repository onto your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
You now have a local copy of the repository where you can make changes.
Step 4: Make Changes and Push to GitHub
Add, edit, or delete files in the repository.
Use Git commands to track and push changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
The changes will be reflected in the GitHub repository.
Step 5: Collaborate with Other Users
1. Fork repositories to contribute to projects or use pull requests to suggest
changes.
2. Collaborators can review code, discuss changes, and merge contributions.
Step 6: Use GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
1. Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deploying applications.
Create a .github/workflows folder and define a YAML file for workflows.

Example workflow to run tests:
yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Run tests
run: npm test
Step 7: Explore GitHub Features
 GitHub Issues: Use for tracking bugs and feature requests.
 GitHub Projects: Manage tasks in a Kanban-style board.
 GitHub Pages: Host static websites directly from the repository.
